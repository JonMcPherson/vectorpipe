VectorPipe (VP) is a library for working with OpenStreetMap (OSM) vector
data. Powered by [Geotrellis](http://geotrellis.io) and [Apache
Spark](http://spark.apache.org/).

OSM provides a wealth of data which has broad coverage and a deep history.
This comes at the price of very large size which can make accessing the power
of OSM difficult.  VectorPipe can help by making OSM processing in Apache
Spark possible, leveraging large computing clusters to churn through the large
volume of, say, an OSM full history file.

For those cases where an application needs to process incoming changes, VP
also provides streaming Spark `DataSource`s for changesets, OsmChange files,
and Augmented diffs generated by Overpass.

For ease of use, the output of VP imports is a Spark DataFrame containing
columns of JTS `Geometry` objects, enabled by the user-defined types provided
by [GeoMesa](https://github.com/locationtech/geomesa).  That package also
provides functions for manipulating those geometries via Spark SQL directives.

The final important contribution is a set of functions for exporting
geometries to vector tiles.  This leans on the `geotrellis-vectortile`
package.
